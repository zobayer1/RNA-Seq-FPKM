# RNA-Seq Data Analysis
In this assignment, you have to analyse data taken from RNA-Seq Experiments. This document will guide you.

## Dataset
We are going to use gene expression arrays from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website. For example: [GSE183947](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183947) contains expression profiling by Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing. In total, 30 pairs of normal and cancerous tissues from the same excision were collected from the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Guangzhou Army General Hospital. RNA sequencing was performed by Guangzhou Huayin Health medical Group. Original reads of RNA sequencing data were normalized as FPKM data. You can use this or any other RNA-Seq data. 

## Task
You have to perform the following tasks:
- First load the data. You have to use R/Python Script
- Perform differential gene expression analysis. Use dseq2 or any other algorithms. 
- Draw volcano plot and MA plot of the results
- Perform a downstream analysis on the gene set and report the results (enrichment/pathway analysis/functional annotation). You can use any of the following or similar: DAVID, GSEA. 

## Output
You have to submit a report on the experiments - 2.5 marks for each of the tasks, 10 in total.
